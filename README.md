# Google Maps API test webpage
The idea behind this mini project is to create a single page web application with react and the Google Maps API. The basic prerequisites for the project are node.js, npm or yarn, and a Google Maps API key.

### Google Maps Platform

To get started with Google Maps Platform you will need to have a billing account (although getting an API kep is free).  With the billing account setup you can create a project, enable one or more APIs and then generate your API key.  The Google Maps Platform 'Get Started' guide takes you through all the steps you needd to do to get an API key: https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started

### Node.js and npm/yarn

### Getting started with react
To install the react-google-maps api package run: $npm i -S @react-google-maps/api  or $yarn add @react-google-maps/api
